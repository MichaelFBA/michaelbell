<blockquote>
<p>You start out as a single cell derived from the coupling of a sperm and an egg; this divides in two, then four, then eight, and so on, and at a certain stage there emerges a single cell which has as all its progeny the human brain. The mere existence of such a cell should be one of the great astonishments of the earth. People ought to be walking around all day, all through their waking hours calling to each other in endless wonderment, talking of nothing except that cell.</p>

<p><strong>Family.</strong> Between relatives or insects. Blood, feuds, legal, large, small, together or apart, reliable. Family is a connotation that is as old as us all. Yet it is interpreted uniquely among us all.</p>
<p>Family <em>can</em> be complicated. Growing up I had a relatively normal suburban upbringing in Australia. I had a younger brother, we had a backyard with a trampoline and played soccer on the weekends. My mother worked at the local credit union and my father was a printer who did night shift. Suffice to say I didn't see much of him. After their divorce when I was about twelve I went to live with my mother. </p>
<p>Live goes on as it usually does. I think I might have been depressed and turned to drugs but with all the other things that are happening in the mind of a young man I coped just fine. There was very little to do for the juveniles in the area we lived and like most I was aching to leave.</p>
<p>Eventually after saving some money with my partner I left and never really went back. Instead of investing and buying some crappy old house I decided to travel the world and go down every dark alley I could find. Looking for something interesting and meeting the vagabonds of the world. I was transformed.</p>
<p>I also saw all the depravity in the world, the families struggling. The babies offered to a foreigner who might have provided a better life to their own children. I was sinking into the realisation that having a family would mean bringing another human into this world. Another broken home, more heartache and anguish and for what?</p>
<p>And so it was. </p>
<p>And so at about 35, which is quite the age. My partner said she would like to have a child.
I had mellowed a <em>little</em> and time was of the essense as I was told. We had a daughter, my partner named her Luna. I would have named him <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(mythology)#:~:text=Atlas%20and%20his%20brother%20Menoetius,the%20sky%20on%20his%20shoulders.">Atlas</a> </p>
<p>Please dont get my wrong my daughter is getting more interesting by the day and I love her. </p>
<p>There is an exorbitant amount of time and energy that goes into creating a family and I applaud all the other mothers / fathers out there. But I think I have learned a thing or two about minimalism to know that it can also apply to your family. </p>
<p>We live in a world where there are probably more than 8 Billion people and counting, where animals can have thousands / millions of offspring to increase the odds of one of them surviving. Humans on the other hand have seen the <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen?language=en">global life expectancy</a> nearly double in a very short space of time. </p>
<p>I understand there are large groups of people (looking at the boomers), who desperately need young people to pay taxes and keep the economy / mousewheel turning. Me I don't have the slighest faith in pensions supporting our generation in the future.</p>
